/** One session actor owns one resource of type `R`. Spawned on a
  * `PinnedDispatcher` (see `application.conf`) so the actor's receive method
  * runs on the same OS thread for the actor's lifetime. The resource is
  * constructed lazily inside the actor's setup block, so it captures the pinned
  * thread — every method call on the resource then runs on the thread it was
  * built on.
  *
  * `R` is required to be `AutoCloseable` so the session can release the
  * resource on the pinned thread when it stops or restarts — many thread-affine
  * resources (Graal `Context`, native handles, etc.) require teardown on the
  * same thread that created them.
  *
  * Callers never touch the resource directly. They send `Submit` messages
  * carrying a closure; the actor runs the closure inline with the resource it
  * owns and completes the supplied `Promise` with the result (or the
  * exception).
