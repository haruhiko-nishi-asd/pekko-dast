/** Active probe: inject an audited payload at an injection point and confirm

  * and payload-id checks run in [[precheck]] before any browser work, so a
  * denied or invalid probe never injects. A `Finding` is produced only when the
  * confirm hook reports the probe's marker; the model is never consulted here.
  *
  * The decision logic ([[precheck]], [[firedMarkers]], [[toFinding]]) is pure
  * and unit tested. The browser-driving [[probe]] is exercised only against a
  * live, consenting target (stated, not unit tested).
