/** The deterministic safety floor for LLM-driven form submission (README
  * navigation-action carve-out).
  *
  * GET submissions are read-semantic and allowed. A POST is allowed only when
  * the model classified it non-state-changing AND it survives the destructive-
  * pattern deny-list (action URL + field names + submit text). The model's
  * verdict is necessary, never sufficient: this deny-list is the hard floor, so
  * a model misjudgement still cannot fire a destructive action. PUT/DELETE/etc.
  * and file uploads are always refused. Pure and unit tested.
