/** Pure logic for the SSRF probe (README).
  *
  * SSRF is confirmed out-of-band, which is the only honest signal: inject a URL
  * pointing at a callback listener we control, carrying a unique token. If the
  * target's server fetches it, the listener records the token and the finding
  * is confirmed by that server-side interaction, never guessed from the
  * response body. No callback, no finding.
  *
  * The listener ([[OastListener]]) and the request/poll ([[SsrfProbe]]) are
  * live-only; the URL building and confirm decision here are pure and tested.
