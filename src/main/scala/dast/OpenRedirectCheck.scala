/** Pure logic for the open-redirect probe (README).
  *
  * An open redirect is confirmed deterministically: inject an off-origin
  * sentinel host into a redirect-ish parameter and check whether the server's
  * `Location` header points at that sentinel. No model, no pattern-guessing on
  * the body, no following the redirect into the wild. The sentinel uses the
  * reserved `.example` TLD so it never resolves and the probe never actually
  * leaves the target.
  *
  * The browser-free HTTP request lives in [[OpenRedirectProbe]]; the build /
  * confirm logic here is pure and unit tested.
